- Status: Open

# Overview
[overview]: #overview

One para explanation of the document.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Detail Sections
[detail]: #detail-section

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the document in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the system to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
design to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and
include examples of how the feature is used.

# Known Issues

Detail the known issues with the existing design, explain why the choices are OK
to make in the context of requirements, constraints and assumptions.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

What other alternatives have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved items
[unresolved]: #unresolved-items

What parts of the document are still TBD? Once we close all unresolved items, we
can close the RFC till it is opened again.
