{"name":"Cobra","tagline":"Cobra - Python bindings for the ACI REST API","body":"Cobra [![Build Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/54ea96315ab6cc13528d52b3/badge?branchName=master)](https://app.shippable.com/projects/54ea96315ab6cc13528d52b3/builds/latest) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cobra/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cobra/?badge=latest)\r\n=====\r\n\r\nCobra is the officially supported python bindings for [Cisco APIC REST API][apihome].\r\nIt provides a pythonic library that allows developers to quickly develop and test applications to program the Cisco ACI through the APIC.\r\n\r\n[apihome]: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/1-x/api/rest/b_APIC_RESTful_API_User_Guide.html\r\n[modelhome]: https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-dc/documents/mim-ref/\r\n[acimodel]: https://github.com/datacenter/acimodel\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/datacenter/cobra/issues\r\n\r\n> Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.\r\n>\r\n> *- Confucius*\r\n\r\n\r\n### Design Goals ###\r\n\r\n**Simple.** Pythonic, well documented, easy to develop and test applications.\r\n\r\n**Complete.** Covers the entire APIC REST API.\r\n\r\n**Robust.** Integrate with [ACI Model][acimodel] for client side validation and testing.\r\n\r\n**Light.** Keep the code lean, making it easier to test, optimize and use.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features ###\r\n\r\n* Programattic interface to ACI model through simple python classes\r\n* Works with multiple versions of ACI model\r\n* Provides unit testing capability against a mock APIC Server\r\n* Python 2.7, Python 3.3/3.4 and PyPy support\r\n* 20% speed boost when Cython is available\r\n\r\n### Benefits ###\r\n\r\n* Stable production ready code supported by the ACI team\r\n* Full feature coverage with examples\r\n* Tools for unit testing and debugging\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install ###\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip install --upgrade cython acicobra\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Installing on OS X Mavericks with Xcode 5.1**\r\n\r\nXcode Command Line Tools are required to compile Cython. Install them with\r\nthis command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ xcode-select --install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Xcode 5.1 CLang compiler treats unrecognized command-line options as\r\nerrors; this can cause problems under Python 2.6, for example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nclang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can work around errors caused by unused arguments by setting some\r\nenvironment variables:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments\r\n$ export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments\r\n$ pip install cython acicobra\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation ###\r\n\r\nWe have started documenting the library at http://cobra.readthedocs.org and we would of course greatly appreciate pull requests to help imporve the documentation.\r\n\r\nThe docstrings in the Cobra code base are quite extensive, and we recommend keeping a REPL running while learning the library so that you can query the various modules and classes as you have questions.\r\n\r\nPlease file issues [here][issues]. Please mail your questions to the cobra support team at acicobra@external.cisco.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing ###\r\n\r\nACI datacenter team officially supports and maintains the cobra API. Pull requests are always welcome.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please ensure you have added/updated the appropriate tests (and that all existing tests still pass with your changes), and that your coding style follows PEP 8 and doesn't cause pyflakes to complain.\r\n\r\nCommit messages should be formatted using [AngularJS conventions][ajs] (one-liners are OK for now but body and footer may be required as the project matures).\r\n\r\nComments follow [Google's style guide][goog-style-comments].\r\n\r\n[ajs]: http://goo.gl/QpbS7\r\n[goog-style-comments]: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html#Comments\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors ###\r\n\r\nRavi Chamarthy (@rchamarthy) initially developed the cobra API as a common library for ACI developers. It is heavily used for testing, CLI and scripting of APIC. \r\nMike Timm (@mtimm) and Paul Lesiak (@paullesiak) are the primary contributors who spent numerous hours writing tests, documentation, examples and developed key features to help cobra shape up!\r\n\r\nMike Shields (@mbshields) owns the documentation efforts.\r\n\r\nSai Ram Goli (@ilog) and Praveen Kumar (@kprav33n) provided valuble design insights during the inception of cobra.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License ###\r\n\r\nCopyright 2015 Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
